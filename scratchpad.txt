this project will randomly generate a sentence that features fun words and
unusual structure.

i will come up with a list of sentence-form templates, and draw lists of nifty
adjectives and other word-types from some source online (potentially downloaded).

using a series of random input the program will assemble various words into the
provided template and present the resulting sentence to the user.
