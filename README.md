# Pretty Sentence Generator
This is my first Codecademy Portfolio Project. I will attempt to build a javascript program that presents the user with a randomized sentence every time it is run. I will be building a list of potential sentence templates and inserting into them esoteric words that fulfill grammatical requirements. I expect that the sentences, for the most part, will only barely qualify as sensical.
