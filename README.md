# Pretty Sentence Generator

This is my first Codecademy Portfolio Project.

---
## Goal
>I will attempt to build a javascript program that presents the user with a **randomized sentence** every time it is run. I will be building a list of potential sentence templates and inserting into them esoteric words that fulfill grammatical requirements. I expect that the sentences, for the most part, will only barely qualify as sensical.

---

## Result
>Implementation went pretty much as planned. The sentence structure variation is not as wild as I was hoping for, but due to the chosen vocabulary they are still fun to say. There are a few cases where the resulting sentence does not make sense. There are a lot. They potentially *could* make sense. That's all that matters.
